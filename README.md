**E-commerce Website**

The project involves developing an e-commerce website featuring an interactive and user-friendly interface. The website specializes in selling ice creams and includes essential functionalities like user authentication, product categorization, search operations, and a shopping cart system. Users must sign up before accessing the website by providing their name, email, and password. The entered data is stored in localStorage, which serves as the database for this project. After signing up, users navigate to the login page where they must enter their registered email and password. These credentials are validated against the data stored in localStorage. If the email and password match, users can log in; otherwise, they are prompted to enter the correct details.

The homepage features four primary categories of ice creams: Classic, Chocolate, Fruity, and Nuts. Clicking on a category displays a list of ice creams belonging to that category. Users can add ice creams to the cart by clicking the "Add to Cart" button, and multiple quantities of the same item can also be added. A search bar allows users to find ice creams based on flavor, supporting partial matches to accommodate users with spelling difficulties or lazy search habits. For example, searching for "cho" will display all chocolate-related ice creams. The search results also indicate the number of matching ice cream flavors. Additionally, the homepage includes a "Go to Cart" button that redirects users to the cart page, where they can view and manage their selected items.

The cart page stores all items added by the user. Users can remove unwanted items by clicking the "Remove" button, which triggers a confirmation prompt. Clicking "OK" removes the item, while clicking "Cancel" retains it. The total amount of all items in the cart is displayed, and clicking the "Buy Now" button initiates the checkout process. A confirmation prompt appears, and upon confirmation, the purchase is completed, and the cart is emptied. A "Do You Want to Shop More?" button allows users to return to the homepage to continue shopping.

To enhance the project, the website can include features such as responsive design to ensure seamless usage on both desktop and mobile devices, notifications for actions like successful login, item addition to the cart, and purchase confirmation. Proper validation for user inputs (e.g., email format, password strength) during signup and login is also crucial. Adding filters to the search functionality, such as price range or popularity, could improve the user experience. Storing cart data in localStorage ensures that users can resume shopping even after refreshing the page. Implementing a user profile management system, where users can update their profile details or view order history, would add value to the platform.

This e-commerce website provides a robust shopping experience with features tailored to improve user convenience and engagement. The incorporation of localStorage as a database simplifies development while maintaining functionality. Future enhancements, such as integrating a real database and additional user features, can further elevate the projectâ€™s potential.
